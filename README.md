Fisher Matrix codes in Wolfram Language for the Clustering of Standard Candles method. 

Code 1 implements the model independent approach using only supernovae. Itmakes use of 2 auxiliary files, a CAMB power spectrum and a table with the expected completenss of LSST SN survey under the "Status Quo" observing strategy. If you make use of this code please cite the related paper -- Amendola & Quartin 2021 MNRAS, 504, 3884; arXiv:1912.10255

Code 2 implements the 6x2pt method in the model dependent case. It makes use of files in the sub-directories camb, LSST and Mantz.plots. If you make use of this code please cite the related paper -- Quartin, Amendola & Moraes, arXiv:2111.xxxxx
